## Huh?

Inspired by the old Unix program `fortune`, a terminal application to randomly select a black and white card pairing 
from the game Cards Against Humanity, implemented in Python.

## Why?

Because I can.

## Who?

I made this. But I did get the text files with the cards from [Chris Hallberg](https://crhallberg.com/cah/); thanks!

Cards Against Humanity released the game under a Creative Commons License, which means I can legally make this as well, 
so thanks for that.
